----  

**Exposure**
:   Adjusts the brightness of the image. A value lower than one will make the image darker than normal, and a value greater than one will make it brighter. 

**Post-Processing Mode**
:   Selects a tone mapping operator to use in post-processing.
Currently there are three choices here, but these will likely change in the future:  

* __None__ - disables gamma correction  
* __Gamma correction__ - only perform gamma correction  
* __Tonemap op1__ - the fifth tonemapping operator [listed on this page][10]

The post-processing mode does not update the preview image automatically - you have to resume rendering for it to update.  [This should be fixed in a future version.][11]
