Getting Started With Chunky
===========================

This guide will guide you through setting up your first render.  If you have
not yet installed Chunky, please check out the [Installation
Instructions](install.html).

Loading a World
---------------

When you have started Chunky you should see something like this:

![Chunky Main window](chunky-first-launch.png)

The dialog in the middle asks you to select a world. If you don't see any
worlds listed in the list this is either because your Minecraft installation is
in a non-standard location, or you have no Minecraft saves yet.

You can specify a Minecraft installation directory in the launcher, or navigate
to one of your world directories by clicking the "Browse for Specific World"
button in the "Select World" window.

Selecting Chunks
----------------

When you have loaded a world in Chunky it should look something like this:

You can select some chunks by clicking the left mouse button, or by holsing
<kbd>Shift</kbd> and pressing the left mouse button and dragging to create a
rectangle. Holding <kbd>Ctrl+Shift</kbd> while dragging whil deselect all
chunks inside the rectangle.

Once you have selected some Chunks, go to the "3D Render" tab in the right
hand pane and click the "New Scene" button.
