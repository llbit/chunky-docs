##Tips & Tutorials 

###General Render Tips  

* Disable sunlight when rendering underground scenes or indoor scenes where there is no visible natural light. This will increase the average number of Samples Per Second (SPS) rendered.  
* Disable emitters to greatly decrease the required render time. This however disables all light emitting blocks such as torches, lava etc.  
* Disable gamma correction during long renders to speed up the rendering process. When the image starts to get finished gamma correction can be re-enabled again without losing progress.  Also, hide the [Render Preview Window][1] during renders to speed up overall render time.
* Increase the Ray Depth if you have a scene with many transparent or shiny blocks.  
* The rendering technique used in Chunky (Path Tracing) is very CPU intensive. Therefore, to maximize the speed and efficiency of a render, all CPU threads should be utilized at 100%. If you would like to run Chunky in the background, you can adjust how much CPU is allocated to Chunky. Visit the [Advanced Render Controls][0] page for more information on how to do this.
