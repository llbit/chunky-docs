Skymaps
==================


You can change the skymap under the "Sky" tab of the Render Controls dialog. You can also change the sun position relative to the skymap.  
Chunky currently only accepts skymaps using equirectangular projection with the vertical angle clamped at horizon.  
It is recommended to a large skymap, in order to avoid the sky looking blurry. However, if the skymap is too large it will take a long time to load.
