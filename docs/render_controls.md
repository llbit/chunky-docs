The Render Controls offer several parameters to tweak your render to the desired look.  To access the Render Controls, create new scene or load an existing scene.  The [Render Preview Window][10] accompanies the Render Controls and allows the user to preview their render in real-time.  
Use the menu above to navigate to the different render control pages.  Each page is laid out exactly as the Render Controls panel for Chunky.
